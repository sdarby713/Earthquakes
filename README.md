# Earthquakes

A visualization showing the location and strength of earthquakes occuring during the last seven days.

The page takes data from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson and plots the locations and magnitudes on a Leaflet map. Clicking on an earthquake circle displays the magnitude and location verbally.

### Update

Earthquake markers have been separated along magnitude integer boundaries into different overlay layers so as to allow display selection along this criterion.
